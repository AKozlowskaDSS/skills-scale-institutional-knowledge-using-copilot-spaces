# OctoAcme Project Management Process

## Overview

OctoAcme follows a customer-first, iterative project management approach that emphasizes clear ownership, data-informed decisions, and psychological safety. Our project lifecycle consists of five key phases: **Initiation**, where we validate business needs and create a project one-pager with problem statements, success metrics, and stakeholder alignment; **Planning**, where we break work into shippable increments, define acceptance criteria and Definition of Done, estimate scope, and create release plans; **Execution & Tracking**, where teams build and test features using project boards, pull requests, and continuous integration while maintaining quality through unit, integration, and end-to-end testing; **Release & Deployment**, where we follow standardized deployment checklists with smoke tests, rollback plans, and release notes; and **Retrospective & Continuous Improvement**, where we capture learnings and convert them into actionable improvements with clear owners and timelines.

## Roles and Responsibilities

Three core personas drive project delivery at OctoAcme. **Project Managers (PM)** coordinate delivery activities, manage schedules, risks, and communications, maintain project plans and timelines, facilitate meetings, and ensure transparency across stakeholders through weekly status updates and risk registers. **Product Managers (PdM)** define what should be built to deliver customer and business value, own the product vision, prioritize the roadmap and backlog, collaborate on trade-offs, and validate solutions through user research and metrics. **Developers** design, build, test, and deliver software components that meet acceptance criteria and quality standards, write and maintain tests and documentation, participate in design and code reviews, assist in estimating and planning work, and help identify technical risks. These roles are supported by QA/Testing specialists who validate quality and acceptance criteria, and stakeholders who provide inputs and approvals throughout the project lifecycle.

## Communication and Quality Assurance

OctoAcme maintains a structured communication cadence to ensure alignment and transparency. Teams hold **daily 15-minute standups** focused on progress, blockers, and dependencies; **twice-weekly standups** for delivery teams (or as agreed); **weekly syncs between PM and PdM** to align on priorities and risks; **weekly delivery syncs** to show progress and flag risks; **monthly stakeholder updates** to keep sponsors informed; and **demo/review sessions** at the end of each sprint or milestone. Risk management is integrated into this cadence through a Risk Register that tracks ID, description, impact, likelihood, owner, mitigation plan, and status, with risks reviewed at weekly syncs and escalated through defined paths (Team-level → PM → Product Lead → Sponsor). Quality assurance is embedded throughout execution with mandatory unit tests for new logic, integration tests where applicable, end-to-end smoke tests for critical flows before release, security scanning in CI, pull request reviews requiring at least one approval, and manual QA for feature acceptance when needed. All deployments follow a comprehensive checklist including staging validation, smoke tests, post-deploy verifications, and documented rollback plans.

## Continuous Improvement Culture

OctoAcme prioritizes learning and iterative refinement through structured retrospectives held after each sprint, release, or important milestone. These timeboxed sessions (45-75 minutes) capture what went well, what could be improved, and generate 2-3 prioritized action items with clear owners and due dates to avoid overload. Action items are tracked in the project backlog with success criteria, reviewed in weekly PM syncs, and measured for impact. This commitment to continuous improvement is supported by key artifacts maintained throughout the project lifecycle: Project Charters, Roadmaps and Release Plans, Sprint/Iteration Backlogs, Acceptance Criteria and Definition of Done, Risk Registers, and Retrospective notes with action items. These artifacts serve as a single source of truth for project status and can be added to `.copilot/` directories to provide context for Copilot Spaces, enabling new and existing team members to quickly understand project state and processes.
